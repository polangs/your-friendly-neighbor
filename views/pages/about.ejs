                    Hello! My name is Trae, I am a Software Developer. I'm currently engaged to beautiful Software Developer that gives me the drive and ambition to further myself in this industry. One of my favorite aspects of being a Developer is problem solving. Understanding the multiple different paths you can take to get your end result makes this job incredibly fascinating!
